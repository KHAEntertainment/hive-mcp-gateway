# Prometheus configuration for Hive MCP Gateway (stub)
# NOTE: This is a minimal, example configuration included for convenience.
# - The API does not currently expose Prometheus metrics by default.
# - If you add metrics, point a scrape job at the proper target/path.
# - You can mount this file via docker/docker-compose.yml (monitoring service).

global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
  evaluation_interval: 30s

scrape_configs:
  # Example: scrape an HTTP metrics endpoint exposed by the gateway
  # To use this, ensure the gateway exposes /metrics or your chosen path
  - job_name: hive_gateway
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          # When running with docker compose, Prometheus can reach the service
          # by its container name on the same network
          - hive-mcp-gateway:8001

  # Add additional scrape jobs as needed
