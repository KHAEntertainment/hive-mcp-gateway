# Smithery Integration Plan

## Overview

[Smithery](https://smithery.ai) is a platform for discovering and managing MCP servers. Integrating Tool Gating with Smithery will enable users to easily import and manage MCP servers from the Smithery ecosystem.

## Planned Features

### 1. Smithery CLI Integration

The Tool Gating CLI will include commands to interact with Smithery:

```bash
# Browse Smithery catalog
tool-gating-mcp smithery browse

# Search for specific capabilities
tool-gating-mcp smithery search "github api"

# Import a specific server
tool-gating-mcp smithery add mcp-server-github

# Import servers by category
tool-gating-mcp smithery import --category development

# Sync with Smithery for updates
tool-gating-mcp smithery sync
```

### 2. Automatic Server Discovery

When a user needs tools that aren't currently available:

1. Tool Gating will search Smithery for relevant servers
2. Suggest servers that provide the needed capabilities
3. One-click installation and registration

Example workflow:
```
User: "I need to work with Jira tickets"
Tool Gating: "No Jira tools found. Found 'mcp-server-jira' on Smithery. Install?"
User: "Yes"
Tool Gating: *Downloads, installs, and registers the Jira MCP server*
```

### 3. Smithery API Integration

```python
class SmitheryClient:
    """Client for interacting with Smithery.ai"""
    
    async def search_servers(self, query: str) -> list[SmitheryServer]:
        """Search Smithery catalog for MCP servers"""
        
    async def get_server_details(self, server_id: str) -> ServerDetails:
        """Get detailed information about a server"""
        
    async def install_server(self, server_id: str) -> MCPServerConfig:
        """Download and install a server from Smithery"""
```

### 4. Metadata Enhancement

Smithery provides rich metadata about MCP servers:
- Categories and tags
- Capabilities and tool descriptions
- Installation requirements
- Version information
- User ratings and reviews

This metadata will enhance Tool Gating's discovery and recommendation engine.

### 5. Update Management

- Track installed server versions
- Check for updates periodically
- Notify users of new versions
- Support rollback if needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- [ ] Add Smithery API client
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Basic installation support

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- [ ] Category browsing
- [ ] Bulk import
- [ ] Update notifications
- [ ] Dependency resolution

### Phase 3: Seamless Experience
- [ ] Auto-discovery suggestions
- [ ] One-click workflows
- [ ] Version management
- [ ] Rollback support

## Benefits

1. **Discoverability**: Access to the entire Smithery ecosystem
2. **Ease of Use**: One-command server installation
3. **Quality**: Leverage Smithery's curation and ratings
4. **Updates**: Automatic notification of new versions
5. **Community**: Tap into the broader MCP community

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints

Smithery likely provides:
- `/api/servers` - List all servers
- `/api/servers/search` - Search servers
- `/api/servers/{id}` - Get server details
- `/api/servers/{id}/download` - Download server

### Configuration Storage

Imported servers will be stored in:
```
~/.tool-gating/
├── servers/
│   ├── smithery/
│   │   ├── mcp-server-github/
│   │   ├── mcp-server-jira/
│   │   └── metadata.json
└── config.json
```

### Security Considerations

- Verify server signatures
- Sandbox server execution
- Review permissions before installation
- Allow users to audit server code

## Future Possibilities

1. **Tool Gating on Smithery**: Publish Tool Gating itself to Smithery
2. **Ratings Integration**: Use Smithery ratings in tool scoring
3. **Community Tools**: Share tool collections via Smithery
4. **Analytics**: Contribute usage data back to Smithery (opt-in)

This integration will make Tool Gating the intelligent hub for all MCP tool management, combining local control with cloud discovery.
