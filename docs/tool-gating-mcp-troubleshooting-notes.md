Please resume the troubleshooting we were working on in these last 2 conversations:
Tool-Gating MCP System Deployment (8efe6041-5f90-4249-b0fa-91b40e21b2d6)
Claude-Code Context Management Review (7ead789a-3b3b-4b50-af32-6ee2417a8a9e)

You had sent me this last message and I then reminded you that you have direct access to these files via the Filesystem MCP. When you attempted to use the MCP we ran out of context. 

The code structure looks correct - discover_all_tools() is being called during startup and should iterate through discovered tools. The issue is likely in one of two places:
1. client_manager.server_tools is empty - tools are discovered but not stored there
2. add_tool_sync method is failing - tools aren't being added to the repository
Let's check both:
bash

# Check what's actually in server_tools after startup
cat src/tool_gating_mcp/services/mcp_client_manager.py | grep -A20 -B5 "server_tools"

# Check the add_tool_sync method
cat src/tool_gating_mcp/services/repository.py | grep -A15 "add_tool_sync"
Also, let's add some debug logging to see what's happening in discover_all_tools(). The logs show servers discovering tools but no indication that discover_all_tools() is processing any tools.
The most likely issue is that when the MCP client manager logs "Discovered X tools from server", it's not actually storing them in the server_tools attribute that discover_all_tools() expects to read from.
Can you run those commands to see the MCP client manager's tool storage implementation?

Strategized debugging approach for tool discovery and synchronization.
The user is asking me to examine the code to find where the disconnect is occurring. They want to see:
1. What's in client_manager.server_tools - how tools are stored after discovery
2. The add_tool_sync method to see if there are issues there
I should ask them to run those specific commands to get the code snippets so we can debug the actual issue.

Perfect! I can now see the complete picture of the issue. I found the discover_all_tools() method in the ProxyService class. Let me analyze what we have:

Current Flow Analysis
MCP Client Manager ‚úÖ - Correctly discovers tools and stores in server_tools
python
# In connect_server method
tools_response = await session.list_tools()
tools = tools_response.tools if hasattr(tools_response, 'tools') else []
self.server_tools[name] = tools
logger.info(f"Discovered {len(tools)} tools from {name}")
Repository add_tool_sync ‚úÖ - Simple and correct implementation
python
def add_tool_sync(self, tool: Tool) -> None:
    self._tools[tool.id] = tool
    if tool.id not in self._usage_counts:
        self._usage_counts[tool.id] = 0
ProxyService discover_all_tools() ü§î - This is where the issue likely is
The Problem
Looking at the discover_all_tools() method, the logic looks correct, but there's no logging to confirm it's actually processing tools. Let's add debug logging to see what's happening:

F


edit_file



Engineered comprehensive logging and debugging for tool discovery.

Now let's create a debug script to manually test what's happening with tool discovery:

Summary of Investigation & Next Steps
I found the issue location and added comprehensive debugging! Here's what I discovered:

üîç Root Cause Analysis
The discover_all_tools() method exists and the flow looks correct:

MCP Client Manager ‚úÖ - Correctly discovers tools and stores in server_tools
Repository add_tool_sync ‚úÖ - Simple and functional
ProxyService discover_all_tools() ü§î - Missing logging to confirm execution
üõ†Ô∏è What I Added
1. Enhanced Logging in discover_all_tools()
Added comprehensive debug logging to track:

Number of servers found
Tools processed per server
Individual tool addition (debug level)
Error handling for failed tool processing
Final repository verification
2. Debug Script (debug_tools.py)
Created a step-by-step diagnostic script that:

Connects to MCP servers manually
Shows what's in client_manager.server_tools
Runs discover_all_tools() with full logging
Verifies repository contents
Provides detailed output at each step
3. Easy Runner (run_debug.sh)
Simple shell script to execute the debug process.

üöÄ Next Steps
Run the debug script to identify the exact issue:

bash
cd /Users/bbrenner/tool-gating-mcp
./run_debug.sh
This will show us:

Are tools actually being discovered by MCP servers?
Are they being stored in client_manager.server_tools?
Is discover_all_tools() processing them?
Are they ending up in the repository?
Expected outcomes:

If tools are discovered but not in repository ‚Üí Issue in discover_all_tools() processing
If server_tools is empty ‚Üí Issue in MCP server connection/tool discovery
If repository gets populated ‚Üí Issue might be in the API endpoints or timing
Once you run this debug script, we'll have definitive answers about where the disconnect occurs in the tool discovery pipeline!

Perfect! The error shows we need to activate the virtual environment first. But I also notice something very encouraging in that output you mentioned:

EXCELLENT! The server logs reveal some crucial information!

üéØ Key Findings from Server Logs:
‚úÖ Tool Discovery IS Working
The MCP Client Manager is successfully discovering tools:

context7: 2 tools
basic-memory: 9 tools
puppeteer: 7 tools
exa: 7 tools
Total: 25 tools discovered
‚ùå Missing discover_all_tools() Logs
Critical observation: After "Proxy initialization complete", there are NO logs from the enhanced discover_all_tools() method I added. This means the method is not being called during startup!

‚úÖ System IS Working at Some Level
The successful API calls in the logs show the system is active:

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://apiserver/api/tools/discover "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST http://apiserver/api/tools/provision "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
üîç The Issue: Missing Method Call
Let me check the startup sequence in main.py:

F


read_file



Investigated module import failure and potential logging issues.




Found the issue! The main.py does call await proxy_service.discover_all_tools(), but we're not seeing any logs from it. This suggests the method might be failing silently.

Let's run the simpler debug script first to check basic imports:

bash
cd /Users/bbrenner/tool-gating-mcp
./run_debug.sh
But first, let me create a minimal test to verify if discover_all_tools() is actually being called:

F


write_file



Strategized script modification for simplified debugging process.

F


write_file



Diagnosed project path discrepancy and devised simpler testing strategy.



Run the new debug script which will test step by step:

bash
cd /Users/bbrenner/tool-gating-mcp
./run_debug.sh
This will:

First test the discover_all_tools() method call without MCP connections
Then check basic imports and configuration
Finally offer to run the full MCP connection test
This stepped approach will help us identify exactly where the problem occurs.

Based on the server logs analysis, my hypothesis is:

The discover_all_tools() method is being called during startup, but it's failing silently (likely due to an exception that's being caught somewhere). The missing logs from my enhanced version confirm this.

The tools are being discovered successfully by MCP Client Manager (25 total), but they're not making it into the repository because discover_all_tools() has an unhandled exception.

Let's run the debug script to confirm this theory and pinpoint the exact failure! üéØ

Itqs listing 5 tools now. Before it was only finding the zen-debug one. could the internal LLM just have needed time to catalog everything? It might still be doing so with the gargantuans MCPs like claude-flow with 100 tools


Pondered tool discovery process and potential gradual cataloging






Excellent observation! üéØ You're absolutely right - this could be a timing/processing issue rather than a fundamental bug!

Looking back at those server logs, I notice something important:

üìä Processing Evidence in the Logs
INFO:sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer:Load pretrained SentenceTransformer: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
Batches:   0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]
Batches: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  5.98it/s]
Batches: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 16.01it/s]
... (many more batch processing lines)
The system is clearly processing tool embeddings with sentence transformers, which takes time!

üîÑ What's Likely Happening
MCP Discovery: ‚úÖ Fast (25 tools found immediately)
Embedding Generation: üîÑ Slow (sentence transformer processing each tool)
Indexing/Cataloging: üîÑ Gradual (tools become available over time)
Large MCPs: ‚è≥ Even slower (claude-flow with 100+ tools)
üß™ Let's Test Your Theory
Can you check the current state now?

Option 1: Quick API Check

bash
# Check how many tools are available now
curl http://localhost:8000/api/tools/discover \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "help", "limit": 20}' | jq '.tools | length'
Option 2: Check via Browser/Tool

Hit the /api/tools/discover endpoint
See if more tools appear now
üí° This Would Explain Everything
Why we saw 1 tool initially (zen-debug processed first)
Why it's 5 tools now (more processing completed)
Why my discover_all_tools() logs might not show (method completed, but async indexing continues)
Why the system appears "broken" initially but starts working
üéØ If This Theory Is Correct
The system is actually working correctly - it's just that:

Tool discovery is immediate
Tool indexing/embedding is gradual
Large MCP servers need time to fully process
The API returns available tools as they're processed
Can you confirm how many tools you see now and what they are? This would help validate whether the system is indeed processing more tools over time!

Zen is one of the 5 BTW, the one we thought was missing earlier. Now, that's therre and 10+ others are missing instead. 

I do hope this re-indexing doesnt have to be redone on every shutdown


Investigated tool indexing bottlenecks and potential re-indexing concerns.






Great insight! üéØ This confirms the gradual processing theory and raises an important persistence concern.

üìä Current State Analysis
Zen tools: ‚úÖ Now appearing (5 tools including zen-debug)
Missing tools: ‚ùå 10+ others still processing
Expected total: 25+ from server logs, possibly 100+ if claude-flow is configured
üîç Let's Check What's Missing
F


read_file



Probed server configurations and potential indexing performance issues.




üîç Server Configuration Analysis
From the config, you have 5 MCP servers configured:

context7: 2 tools (docs/library info)
basic-memory: 9 tools (key-value storage)
puppeteer: 7 tools (browser automation)
exa: 7 tools (web search/research)
zen: 5+ tools (AI analysis - the ones you're seeing now)
Expected total: ~30 tools, not 100+ (unless claude-flow is configured elsewhere?)

üö® Critical Persistence Issue
You're absolutely right to be concerned! Let me check if there's any caching:
