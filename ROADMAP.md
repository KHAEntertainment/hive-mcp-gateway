# Tool Gating MCP - Roadmap

## Current Status (v0.2.0) ‚úÖ

- [x] Core tool gating functionality with semantic search
- [x] Cross-server tool integration
- [x] Token budget management
- [x] AI-assisted MCP server registration
- [x] FastAPI-MCP integration for native MCP protocol support
- [x] HTTP/SSE endpoint at `/mcp`
- [x] Documentation for stdio bridge using mcp-proxy

## Phase 1: Native MCP Enhancement (v0.3.0) üöß

### 1.1 Improved MCP Integration
- [ ] Add built-in stdio transport support without requiring mcp-proxy
- [ ] Implement streamable HTTP transport (new MCP standard)
- [ ] Add operation IDs optimization for cleaner tool names
- [ ] Support for MCP resources (not just tools)

### 1.2 Enhanced Tool Metadata
- [ ] Add tool versioning support
- [ ] Implement tool dependency tracking
- [ ] Add execution time estimates
- [ ] Support for tool categories/namespaces

## Phase 2: Smithery Integration (v0.4.0) üéØ

### 2.1 Smithery CLI Integration
- [ ] Add `import-from-smithery` command
- [ ] Implement Smithery API client
- [ ] Support bulk import of MCP servers from Smithery
- [ ] Add Smithery server metadata caching

### 2.2 Automatic Discovery
- [ ] Browse Smithery catalog directly from Tool Gating
- [ ] Search Smithery servers by capability
- [ ] One-click installation of Smithery servers
- [ ] Automatic dependency resolution

### 2.3 Smithery Sync
- [ ] Periodic sync with Smithery for updates
- [ ] Version tracking and update notifications
- [ ] Automatic tool re-indexing on updates

Example workflow:
```bash
# Import servers from Smithery
tool-gating-mcp import-smithery --category "development"

# Search Smithery catalog
tool-gating-mcp search-smithery "github api"

# Install specific server
tool-gating-mcp add-smithery "mcp-server-github"
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (v0.5.0) üöÄ

### 3.1 Smart Tool Orchestration
- [ ] Tool chaining and workflows
- [ ] Conditional tool selection based on context
- [ ] Tool result caching
- [ ] Parallel tool execution support

### 3.2 Learning & Optimization
- [ ] Usage analytics and patterns
- [ ] ML-based tool recommendation
- [ ] Personalized tool ranking
- [ ] Context-aware token budget optimization

### 3.3 Enterprise Features
- [ ] Multi-user support with profiles
- [ ] Role-based tool access control
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Custom embedding models

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (v1.0.0) üåê

### 4.1 Universal MCP Hub
- [ ] Web UI for tool management
- [ ] GraphQL API for advanced queries
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Tool marketplace integration

### 4.2 Developer Experience
- [ ] SDK for custom tool development
- [ ] Tool testing framework
- [ ] Performance profiling tools
- [ ] Documentation generator

### 4.3 Community Features
- [ ] Public tool registry
- [ ] Tool ratings and reviews
- [ ] Sharing tool collections
- [ ] Community-contributed tool packs

## Technical Debt & Improvements üîß

### Ongoing
- [ ] Migrate from sentence-transformers to lighter embedding solution
- [ ] Implement proper async throughout (currently mixed)
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Improve error messages and debugging
- [ ] Add telemetry (opt-in)
- [ ] Optimize startup time
- [ ] Add health checks for registered servers

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Add integration tests for MCP protocol
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Implement stress testing
- [ ] Add security scanning
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Community & Documentation üìö

- [ ] Create video tutorials
- [ ] Write blog posts about architecture
- [ ] Create example tool packs
- [ ] Build demo applications
- [ ] Host community calls
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines

## Vision Statement üéØ

Tool Gating MCP aims to become the intelligent middleware layer that makes working with hundreds of MCP tools as simple as describing what you need. By integrating with Smithery and other tool ecosystems, we're building towards a future where AI assistants can dynamically discover and use exactly the right tools for any task, without context limitations.
