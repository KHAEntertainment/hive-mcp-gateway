# Hive MCP Gateway - Roadmap

## Recommendations
‚è∫ üöÄ Recommendations for Hive MCP Gateway

  1. Protocol Completeness Improvements

  High Priority

  - Add Resource Support: Implement MCP Resources to expose discovered tools as browsable resources
  - Add Prompts Feature: Create prompt templates for common workflows (e.g., "Find and provision web tools")
  - Implement Subscriptions: Allow clients to subscribe to tool list changes
  - Add Progress Tracking: For long-running tool discovery/execution

  Medium Priority

  - Sampling Support: Enable servers to request LLM assistance for intelligent tool selection
  - Roots Support: Accept root URIs to scope tool discovery
  - Cancellation: Add request cancellation for long operations
  - MCP Logging: Implement proper MCP logging protocol

  2. Security Enhancements

  # Add to main.py for SSE security
  @app.get("/mcp")
  async def mcp_endpoint(request: Request):
      # DNS rebinding protection
      origin = request.headers.get("origin", "")
      if origin and not origin.startswith(("http://localhost", "http://127.0.0.1")):
          raise HTTPException(403, "Invalid origin")
      # ... existing code

  3. Architecture Refinements

  - Implement connection pooling for backend servers
  - Add caching layer for tool embeddings
  - Support WebSocket transport for real-time updates

## Vision Statement üéØ

Hive MCP Gateway aims to become the universal proxy layer for the MCP ecosystem, enabling AI assistants to dynamically discover and use tools from any MCP server while maintaining optimal context usage. By acting as an intelligent router between clients and servers, we're building towards a future where managing hundreds of MCP tools is as simple as connecting to a single, smart proxy that understands what you need.
