"""
Tool Gating MCP Test Suite

This test suite focuses on core capabilities rather than specific tools:
- System flow testing (discovery → registration → execution)
- Resource management and constraints
- Cross-server integration patterns
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- API contract compliance

The tests use generic, parameterized data that represents real patterns
without hardcoding specific tools, making them robust to changes in
the tool ecosystem.
